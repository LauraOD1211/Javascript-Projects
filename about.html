					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					<p>Bananarama is a company that prides itself on selling only the highest quality bananas and banana-related produce. Our aim is to provide delicious, healthy bananas at low 
					prices to our customers all over the globe. All of our bananas are 100% organic and are picked fresh before delivery. We promise that no matter where in the world you are, we
					will be able to have your order delivered straight to your door. 
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>Bananarama was founded in 1986, in Donegal, Ireland. Our founder dreamed of a world where anyone, anywhere on the planet could have a banana delivered straight to their door. 
					Now, after years of hard work, this dream has become a reality. In 2017, the company hit an important milestone when they shipped a banana to Antartica, meaning they had finally 
					sold a banana in every country in the world. Now the company plans to expand their business to cover the entire solar system, with plans to have a banana sent to mars by 2030.<br><br>
